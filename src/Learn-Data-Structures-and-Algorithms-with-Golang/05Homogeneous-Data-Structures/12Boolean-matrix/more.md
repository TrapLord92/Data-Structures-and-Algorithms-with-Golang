A Boolean matrix is a matrix in which the entries are either `true` or `false` (or equivalently, 1 or 0). These matrices are widely used in various real-world applications across different domains due to their simplicity and powerful expressive capabilities. Here are some notable use cases:

### 1. **Graph Theory and Network Analysis**
Boolean matrices are used to represent adjacency matrices of graphs:
- **Adjacency Matrix**: In an undirected or directed graph, a Boolean matrix can represent whether there is an edge between vertices \(i\) and \(j\). If there is an edge, the entry is `true` (or 1); otherwise, it is `false` (or 0).
- **Reachability Matrix**: This matrix helps in determining whether a path exists between two nodes in a graph.

### 2. **Database Systems**
In database systems, Boolean matrices can be used for efficient query processing:
- **Join Operations**: Boolean matrices can represent the join conditions between tables, allowing for efficient computation of join operations.
- **Binary Association Rules**: Representing itemsets in transactions, which are used in market basket analysis.

### 3. **Image Processing**
Boolean matrices are used in image processing for:
- **Binary Images**: Representing binary images where each pixel is either black or white.
- **Morphological Operations**: Performing operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing on binary images.

### 4. **Social Network Analysis**
Boolean matrices can model relationships between individuals in social networks:
- **Friendship Matrix**: A matrix where entry \((i, j)\) is `true` if person \(i\) is friends with person \(j\).
- **Influence Analysis**: Determining the spread of influence or information across the network.

### 5. **Computer Science**
Boolean matrices are used in various computer science applications:
- **Automata Theory**: Representing state transitions in finite automata.
- **Boolean Algebra**: Simplifying logic circuits and designing digital circuits.

### 6. **Operations Research**
Boolean matrices are applied in operations research for:
- **Assignment Problems**: Representing assignments in tasks where an entry is `true` if a task is assigned to a resource.
- **Scheduling Problems**: Modeling constraints and dependencies between tasks.

### Example Code
Here is an example of how to work with a Boolean matrix in Go. We'll represent a simple graph and perform basic operations on it:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Function to create an adjacency matrix for a graph
func createAdjacencyMatrix(size int, edges [][2]int) [][]bool {
	matrix := make([][]bool, size)
	for i := range matrix {
		matrix[i] = make([]bool, size)
	}
	for _, edge := range edges {
		matrix[edge[0]][edge[1]] = true
		matrix[edge[1]][edge[0]] = true // For undirected graph
	}
	return matrix
}

// Function to print the adjacency matrix
func printMatrix(matrix [][]bool) {
	for _, row := range matrix {
		for _, val := range row {
			if val {
				fmt.Print("1 ")
			} else {
				fmt.Print("0 ")
			}
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
}

func main() {
	// Define edges of the graph
	edges := [][2]int{
		{0, 1},
		{0, 2},
		{1, 2},
		{1, 3},
	}

	// Create adjacency matrix
	size := 4
	adjMatrix := createAdjacencyMatrix(size, edges)

	// Print the adjacency matrix
	fmt.Println("Adjacency Matrix:")
	printMatrix(adjMatrix)
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to create and print an adjacency matrix for a simple undirected graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges. The output will be:

```
Adjacency Matrix:
0 1 1 0 
1 0 1 1 
1 1 0 0 
0 1 0 0 
```

Boolean matrices are powerful tools in various domains, offering efficient and intuitive ways to represent and manipulate binary relationships and data.
