We will talk about data structures, including linear, non-linear, homogeneous,
heterogeneous, and dynamic types, as well as classic algorithms. This section covers
different types of lists, trees, arrays, sets, dictionaries, tuples, heaps, queues, and stacks,
along with sorting, recursion, searching, and hashing algorithms.
This section contains the following chapters:
# Chapter 3, Linear Data Structures
# Chapter 4, Non-Linear Data Structures
# Chapter 5, Homogeneous Data Structures
# Chapter 6, Heterogeneous Data Structures
# Chapter 7, Dynamic Data Structures
# Chapter 8, Classic Algorithms
