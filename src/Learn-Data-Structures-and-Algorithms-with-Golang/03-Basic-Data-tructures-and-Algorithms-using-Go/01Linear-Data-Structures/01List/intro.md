# Lists
A list is a collection of ordered elements that are used to store list of items. Unlike array
lists, these can expand and shrink dynamically.
Lists also be used as a base for other data structures, such as stack and queue. Lists can be
used to store lists of users, car parts, ingredients, to-do items, and various other such
elements. Lists are the most commonly used linear data structures. These were introduced
in the lisp programming language.
# In this chapter, linked list and doubly linked list 
are the
lists we will cover in the Go language.
Let's discuss the operations related to add, update, remove, and lookup on linked list and
doubly linked list in the following section.
