# Linear Data Structures
Various applications, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, use lists and linear data
structures. As we have discussed previously, data structures allow us to organize vast
swathes of data in a sequential and organized manner, thereby reducing time and effort in
working with such data. Lists, stacks, sets, and tuples are some of the commonly used
linear data structures.
In this chapter, we will discuss these data structures by giving examples of various
procedures involving them. We will discuss the various operations related to these data
structures, such as insertion, deletion, updating, traversing (of lists), reversing, and
merging with various code samples.
We will cover the following linear data structures in this chapter:
## Lists
## Sets
## Tuples
## Stacks
