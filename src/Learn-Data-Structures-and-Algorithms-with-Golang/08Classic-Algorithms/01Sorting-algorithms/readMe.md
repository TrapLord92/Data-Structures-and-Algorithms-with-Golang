# Sorting
Sorting algorithms arrange the elements in a collection in ascending or descending order.
Lexicographical order can be applied to a collection of characters and strings. The efficiency
of these algorithms is in the performance of sorting the input data into a sorted collection.
The best sorting algorithm time complexity is O(n log n). Sorting algorithms are classified
by the following criteria:
Computational complexity
Memory usage
Stability
Type of sorting: serial/parallel
Adaptability
Method of sorting
In the following sections, we'll look at the different sorting algorithms, that is, bubble,
selection, insertion, shell, merge, and quick.
