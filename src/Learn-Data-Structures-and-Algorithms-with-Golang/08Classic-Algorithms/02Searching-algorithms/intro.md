Searching
Search algorithms are used to retrieve information that's stored in a data source or a
collection. The algorithm is given the key of the element in question, and the associated
value will be found. Search algorithms return a true or a false Boolean value based on the
availability of the information. They can be enhanced to display multiple values related to
the search criteria. Different types of search algorithms include linear, binary, and
interpolation. These algorithms are categorized by the type of search. Search algorithms
include brute force and heuristic methods. The algorithms are chosen for their efficiency.
Different factors for choosing these algorithms are as follows:
Input type
Output type
Definiteness
Correctness
Finiteness
Effectiveness
Generality
In this section, we will discuss the different types of search algorithms.
