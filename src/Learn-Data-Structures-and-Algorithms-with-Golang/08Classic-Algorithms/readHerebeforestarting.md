# Classic Algorithms
Classic algorithms are used in the areas of data search and cryptography. Sorting,
searching, recursing, and hashing algorithms are good examples of classic
algorithms. Sorting algorithms are used to order elements into either an ascending or
descending key arrangement. These algorithms are frequently used to canonicalize data
and to create readable content. Search algorithms are used to find an element in a set. A
recursive algorithm is one that calls itself with input items. A hashing algorithm is a
cryptographic hash technique. It is a scientific calculation that maps data with a subjective
size to a hash with a settled size. It's intended to be a single direction function, that you
cannot alter.
In this chapter, we will cover the different classic algorithms and explain them with suitable
examples.
This chapter covers the following algorithms:
