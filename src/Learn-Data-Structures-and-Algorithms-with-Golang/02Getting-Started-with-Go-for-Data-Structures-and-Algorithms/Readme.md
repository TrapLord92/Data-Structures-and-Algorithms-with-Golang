Getting Started with Go for
Data Structures and Algorithms
The Go programming language has been rapidly adopted by developers for building web
applications. With its impressive performance and ease of development, Go enjoys the
support of a wide variety of open source frameworks for building scalable and highly
performant web services and apps. The migration to Golang has taken place mainly
because of its fast, lightweight, and inbuilt concurrency features. This brings with it the
need to learn data structures and algorithms with this growing language.
In data structures, a collection of elements of a single type is called an array. Slices are
similar to arrays except that they have unusual properties. Slice operations such as
enlarging a slice using append and copy methods, assigning parts of a slice, appending a
slice, and appending a part of a slice are presented with code samples. Database operations
and CRUD web forms are the scenarios in which Go data structures and algorithms are
demonstrated.
In this chapter, we will discuss the following Go language-specific data structures:
Arrays
Slices
Two-dimensional slices
Maps
Database operations
Variadic functions
CRUD web forms
