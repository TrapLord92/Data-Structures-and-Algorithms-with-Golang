Dynamic Data Structures
A dynamic data structure is a set of elements in memory that has the adaptability to
expand or shrink. This ability empowers a software engineer to control precisely how much
memory is used. Dynamic data structures are used for handling generic data in a key-value
store. They can be used in distributed caching and storage management. Dynamic data
structures are valuable in many circumstances in which dynamic addition or deletion of
elements occur. They are comparable in capacity to a smaller relational database or an inmemory
database. These data structures are used in marketing and customer relationship
management applications. Dictionaries, TreeSets, and sequences are examples of dynamic
data structures.
In this chapter, we will explain what dictionaries, TreeSets, and sequences are and show
you how they are implemented with the help of code examples.
This chapter covers the following dynamic data structures:
Dictionaries
TreeSets:
Synchronized TreeSets
Mutable TreeSets
Sequences:
Farey
Fibonacci
Look-and-say
Thueâ€“Morse
