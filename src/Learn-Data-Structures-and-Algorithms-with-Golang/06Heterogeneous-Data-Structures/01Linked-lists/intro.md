Linked lists
A linked list is a linear collection of elements with information. The linked list shrinks or
expands based on whether the components are to be included or removed. This list can be
small or enormous, yet, regardless of the size, the elements that make it up are
straightforward. Linked lists were covered in Chapter 3, Linear Data Structures. They
consume more memory than arrays. Reverse traversing is a problem for singly linked lists
because a singly linked list points to the next node forward. The next section explains how
to reverse a singly linked list with a code example.
