Heterogeneous Data Structures
Heterogeneous data structures are data structures that contain diverse types of data, such
as integers, doubles, and floats. Linked lists and ordered lists are good examples of these
data structures. They are used for memory management. A linked list is a chain of elements
that are associated together by means of pointers. Each element's pointer links to the
following item, which connects the chain together. Linked lists don't have to take up a
block of memory. The memory that they utilize can be allocated dynamically. It comprises a
progression of nodes, which are the components of the list. Ordered lists and unordered
lists from HTML are shown to demonstrate the usage of lists and storage management. We
will cover linked lists, ordered lists, and unordered lists in this chapter and show the
implementation of their methods with appropriate examples. This chapter covers the
following heterogeneous data structures:
Linked lists
Ordered lists
