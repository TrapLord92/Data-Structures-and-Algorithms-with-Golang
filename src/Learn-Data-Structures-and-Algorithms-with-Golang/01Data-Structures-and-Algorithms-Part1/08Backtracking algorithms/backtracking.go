/*A backtracking algorithm solves a problem by constructing the solution incrementally.
Multiple options are evaluated, and the algorithm chooses to go to the next component of
the solution through recursion. Backtracking can be a chronological type or can traverse the
paths, depending on the problem that you are solving.

Backtracking is an algorithm that finds candidate solutions and rejects a candidate on the
basis of its feasibility and validity. Backtracking is useful in scenarios such as finding a
value in an unordered table. It is faster than a brute force algorithm, which rejects a large
number of solutions in an iteration. Constraint satisfaction problems such as parsing, rules
engine, knapsack problems, and combinatorial optimization are solved using backtracking.
The following is an example of a backtracking algorithm. The problem is to identify the
combinations of elements in an array of 10 elements whose sum is equal to 18. The
findElementsWithSum method recursively tries to find the combination. Whenever the
sum goes beyond the k target, it backtracks:*/
//findElementsWithSum  of k from arr of size
func findElementsWithSum(arr [10]int, combinations [19]int, size int, k int, addValue int, l int, m int) int {

	var num int = 0

	if addValue > k {
		return -1
	}

	if addValue == k {
		num = num + 1
		var p int = 0
		for p = 0; p < m; p++ {

			fmt.Printf("%d,", arr[combinations[p]])
		}
		fmt.Println(" ")
	}

	var i int
	for i = l; i < size; i++ {

		//fmt.Println(" m", m)
		combinations[m] = l

		findElementsWithSum(arr, combinations, size, k, addValue+arr[i], l, m+1)
		l = l + 1
	}
	return num
}

// main method
func main() {

	var arr = [10]int{1, 4, 7, 8, 3, 9, 2, 4, 1, 8}

	var addedSum int = 18

	var combinations [19]int

	findElementsWithSum(arr, combinations, 10, addedSum, 0, 0, 0)

	//fmt.Println(check)

	//var check2 bool = findElement(arr,9)

	//fmt.Println(check2)
