# Non-linear data structures are used in cryptography and other areas. A non-linear data
structure is an arrangement in which an element is connected to many elements. These
structures use memory quickly and efficiently. Free contiguous memory is not required for
adding new elements.
The length of the data structures is not important before adding new elements. A non-linear
data structure has multiple levels and a linear one has a single level. The values of the
elements are not organized in a non-linear data structure. The data elements in a non-linear
data structure cannot be iterated in one step. The implementation of these data structures is
complicated.
Tree types such as binary search trees, treaps, and symbol tables are explained in this
chapter.
# This chapter covers the following non-linear data structures:
## Trees
## Tables
## Containers
## Hash functions
