Trees
A tree is a non-linear data structure. Trees are used for search and other use cases. A binary
tree has nodes that have a maximum of two children. A binary search tree consists of nodes
where the property values of the left node are less than the property values of the right
node. The root node is at level zero of a tree. Each child node could be a leaf.
