Advanced Data
Structures and Algorithms using
Go
Network representation, sparse matrix representation, memory management, instance
based learning, compiler translation, and process scheduling-related data structures and
algorithms are presented in this section. The data structures shown in the algorithms are
graphs, list of lists, AVL trees, K-D trees, ball trees, Van Emde Boas trees, buffer trees, and
red-black trees. Cache-oblivious data structures and data flow analysis are covered with
code examples and efficiency analysis.
This section contains the following chapters:
Chapter 9, Network and Sparse Matrix Representation
Chapter 10, Memory Management
