Network and Sparse Matrix
Representation
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the values are zero. The ratio of zero values to
non-zero values is known as the sparsity. An estimation of a matrix's sparsity can be
helpful when creating hypotheses about the availability of networks. Extensive big sparse
matrices are commonly used in machine learning and natural language parsing. It is
computationally costly to work with them. Recommendation engines use them for
representing products inside a catalog. Computer vision uses sparse matrices and network
data structures when working with pictures that contain sections with dark pixels. Network
and sparse matrix data structures are also used in social graphs and map layouts. In this
chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Network representations using graphs:
Social network representation
Map layouts
Knowledge graphs
Sparse matrix representation using a list of lists
A social graph that connects people is implemented in this chapter, and a code example
