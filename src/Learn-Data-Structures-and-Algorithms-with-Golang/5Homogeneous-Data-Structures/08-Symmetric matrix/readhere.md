A symmetric matrix is a matrix whose transpose is equal to itself. Symmetric matrices
include other types of matrices such as antimetric, centrosymmetric, circulant, covariance,
coxeter, hankel, hilbert, persymmetric, skew-symmetric, and toeplitz matrices. A
negative matrix is a matrix in which each element is a negative number.
