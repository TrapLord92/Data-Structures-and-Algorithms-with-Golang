Data-Structure
Data structures are concrete representations of data and are defined as a programmer point of view. Data-structure
represents how data will be stored in memory. All data-structures have their own pros and cons. Depending upon the
type problem we pick a data-structure that is best suited for it.
For example, we can store data in an array, a linked-list, stack, queue, tree, etc.
