Length of array 10
Analysis:
路 We had declared array arr of size 10. In Go language, the array size is a part of array. The array name is whole
array and not pointer to first element like that in C/ C++.
路 By default, all the elements of array are initialized to their default value. For our example, the default value of int
type is 0.
路 We can read and set each element of array.
路 We can get size of array by using built-in function len().*/
