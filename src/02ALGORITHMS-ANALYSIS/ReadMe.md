Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of steps to accomplish a task. Or an algorithm in a computer program in which a set of steps
applied over a set of input to produce a set of output.
Knowledge of algorithm helps us to get desired result faster by applying the right algorithm.
The most important properties of an algorithm are:
1. Correctness: The algorithm should be correct. It should be able to process all the given inputs and provide correct
output.
2. Efficiency: The algorithm should be efficient in solving problems. Efficiency is measured in two parameters. Firs is
Time-Complexity, how fast result is provided by an algorithm. And the second is Space-Complexity, how much
RAM that an algorithm is going to consume to give desired result.
Time-Complexity is represented by function T(n) - time versus the input size n.
Space-Complexity is represented by function S(n) - memory used versus the input size n.
Asymptotic analysis
Asymptotic analysis is used to compare the efficiency of algorithm independently of any particular data set or
programming language.
We are generally interested in the order of growth of some algorithm and not interested in the exact time required for
running an algorithm. This time is also called Asymptotic-running time.
