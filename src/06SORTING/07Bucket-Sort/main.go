Bucket sort is the simplest and most efficient type of sorting. Bucket sort has a strict requirement of a predefined range
of data.
Like, sort how many people are in which age group. We know that the age of people can vary between 0 and 130.*/

/*Analysis:
路 We have created a count list to store counts.
路 Count list elements are initialized to zero.
路 Index corresponding to input list is incremented.
路 Finally, the information stored in count list is saved in the list.
Complexity Analysis:
Data structure List
Worst case performance O(n+k)
Average case performance O(n+k)
Worst case Space Complexity O(k)
k - number of distinct elements.
n - total number of elements in list.*/
